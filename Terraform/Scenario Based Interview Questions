1. Scenario: You need to provision a new AWS EC2 instance using Terraform. What steps would you take to accomplish this?
Answer:

Create a Terraform configuration file that defines the AWS provider and the EC2 instance resource.
Ensure to specify the AMI and instance type.
Initialize Terraform to prepare your working directory.
Plan the deployment to preview the changes that will be made.
Apply the configuration to create the EC2 instance.
Verify the deployment by checking the AWS Management Console.

2. Scenario: Your team is managing multiple environments (development, staging, production) using Terraform. How can you manage configurations for these environments effectively?
Answer:

Use Terraform workspaces to create isolated environments for each stage (development, staging, production).
Create separate variable files for each environment to manage configurations.
Incorporate conditional logic in your configuration files to differentiate resources based on the environment.
Implement a naming convention for resources that reflects the environment to avoid confusion.

3. Scenario: You want to avoid hardcoding sensitive information, such as AWS credentials, in your Terraform configuration. What strategies would you use?
Answer:

Set AWS credentials using environment variables to keep them out of your configuration files.
Use Terraform variable files to define sensitive values and mark them as sensitive to prevent them from being displayed in logs.
Consider integrating with a secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to dynamically retrieve sensitive information.

4. Scenario: You need to ensure that your infrastructure remains consistent and that changes are version-controlled. How would you implement this with Terraform?
Answer:

Store your Terraform configuration files in a version control system (like Git) to track changes over time.
Use a remote backend (such as S3 or Terraform Cloud) to manage the Terraform state file, ensuring it’s not stored locally.
Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the terraform plan and terraform apply processes, ensuring changes are reviewed and tested before deployment.

5. Scenario: You’ve applied changes to your infrastructure, but now you want to revert to the previous state. How can you achieve this with Terraform?
Answer:

Use a previously saved state file to revert your infrastructure to an earlier configuration by reapplying that state.
If resource configurations have changed, you can update the configuration file and reapply it.
Mark resources for recreation if needed, ensuring the infrastructure reflects the desired state.

6. Scenario: Your organization is looking to implement infrastructure as code (IaC) best practices with Terraform. What recommendations would you make?
Answer:

Break down configurations into reusable modules to encapsulate and share infrastructure components.
Use consistent naming conventions for resources to improve readability and maintainability.
Pin provider versions in the required_providers block to avoid unexpected changes.
Document modules and their inputs/outputs to facilitate team understanding and usage.

7. Scenario: You need to provision an S3 bucket with versioning enabled using Terraform. How would you accomplish this?
Answer:

Define an S3 bucket resource in your Terraform configuration and specify the desired properties, including enabling versioning.
Plan and apply the configuration to create the S3 bucket while ensuring it meets your organization's policies for resource naming and tagging.

8. Scenario: You want to manage multiple versions of your infrastructure. How can you use Terraform to handle versioning effectively?
Answer:

Use Git to track changes in your Terraform configuration files, allowing you to manage different versions effectively.
Utilize tags in Git to mark specific versions of your infrastructure that correspond to deployed states.
Manage state files with versioning in a remote backend to ensure consistency across different environments.

9. Scenario: You need to create a security group in AWS that only allows SSH access from a specific IP address. How can you implement this with Terraform?
Answer:

Define an AWS security group resource in your configuration.
Specify the ingress rule that allows SSH access from the designated IP address while ensuring compliance with security best practices regarding egress rules.

10. Scenario: You want to create a Lambda function in AWS using Terraform. What are the key components you need to define in your Terraform configuration?
Answer:

Define the AWS provider in your configuration.
Create an IAM role that the Lambda function can assume, with a policy allowing the necessary permissions.
Specify the Lambda function resource with relevant properties such as handler, runtime, and source code location.
Optionally, define triggers to initiate the Lambda function, such as API Gateway or S3 events.

11. Scenario: Your organization has a policy of using only specific regions for resource deployment. How can you enforce this using Terraform?
Answer:

Define a variable for the region and set allowed values to enforce compliance.
Use validation rules within your variable definitions to ensure only permitted regions are specified.

12. Scenario: You need to implement a CI/CD pipeline that includes Terraform for infrastructure deployment. What steps would you take to set this up?
Answer:

Store your Terraform configurations in a Git repository to facilitate collaboration.
Integrate CI/CD tools to automate the deployment process by triggering infrastructure changes based on code commits.
Ensure the pipeline includes steps to plan and apply Terraform changes, with manual approvals for critical deployments.

13. Scenario: You have existing resources managed outside of Terraform, and you want to import them into Terraform management. What is the process for doing this?
Answer:

Create the appropriate resource configurations in Terraform that match the existing resources.
Use the Terraform import feature to bring those resources into Terraform's state management.
Run a plan to ensure that the configurations and the current state are aligned.

14. Scenario: You need to manage secrets and sensitive data in your Terraform configurations securely. What strategies would you use?
Answer:

Use sensitive variables to ensure that sensitive information is not logged or displayed in output.
Store secrets in encrypted storage solutions and retrieve them dynamically using appropriate Terraform providers.
Consider using workspaces to manage sensitive information across different environments without hardcoding values.

15. Scenario: You want to implement a modular approach for your Terraform configurations. How can you achieve this?
Answer:

Create separate directories for each resource type and define them as modules.
Use module blocks in your root configuration to reference these modules.
Define input variables for your modules to parameterize configurations, making them reusable across different deployments.
