Linux Scenario Based Interview Questions

1. Scenario: A critical service has stopped on a production server. How would you troubleshoot and restart the service?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	Check the service status: Use systemctl status <service_name> to determine the current state of the service (active, inactive, or failed). This command provides information on the last log entries that may help pinpoint why the service stopped.
2.	Check logs: Look at the logs for clues. Use journalctl -u <service_name> to view logs related to the specific service or /var/log/syslog for system-wide logs. This will help you find any critical errors or warnings.
3.	Restart the service: To bring the service back online, use systemctl restart <service_name>. This command attempts to restart the service, and if it fails again, you may need to look deeper into configuration or resource issues.
4.	Check resource usage: Run top or htop to inspect CPU and memory usage. If the server is running out of resources, it may be causing the service to crash.
5.	Check disk space: Use df -h to see if the disk is full. Services often fail if there’s no free space for logs or operations.
6.	Validate service configuration: Inspect the service’s configuration file (for example, Nginx has /etc/nginx/nginx.conf) to ensure that settings are correct and haven’t been corrupted.

2. Scenario: You need to give non-root users access to a directory but with restricted permissions. How would you achieve this?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	Change directory ownership: Use chown <user>:<group> <directory> to assign the ownership of the directory to a specific user and group. This ensures only the intended user/group has control over the directory.
2.	Set permissions: Apply chmod to assign specific access levels. For example, chmod 750 gives the owner full permissions, the group read and execute, and others no access.
3.	Advanced permission control: For more granular access control, use setfacl. With setfacl -m u:<user>:rwx <directory>, you can provide specific permissions to multiple users without affecting group permissions.

********

3. Scenario: A script scheduled via cron has stopped running. How would you troubleshoot it?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	List cron jobs: Run crontab -l (for user-specific cron jobs) or check /etc/crontab for system-wide jobs. Ensure the cron job hasn’t been accidentally removed or modified.
2.	Check cron logs: Use grep CRON /var/log/syslog (on Debian-based systems) or /var/log/cron (on RedHat-based systems) to look for errors in cron’s execution.
3.	Ensure script is executable: Verify that the script has execute permissions using chmod +x <script>.
4.	Environment differences: Cron operates in a limited environment, so ensure all necessary environment variables are defined within the script or cron job.
5.	Test manually: Run the script manually in the terminal to confirm whether the issue is with the cron job or the script itself.

********

4. Scenario: You need to debug network issues on a Linux server. What tools would you use?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	ping: Use ping <hostname/IP> to check if the server can reach the target host and verify basic network connectivity.
2.	traceroute: Run traceroute <hostname/IP> to track the path that packets take to the destination. This helps identify where delays or failures occur in the network path.
3.	netstat or ss: Use netstat -tuln or ss -tuln to see active connections, listening ports, and associated processes. This is useful to verify that your service is listening on the correct port.
4.	tcpdump: Capture network traffic with tcpdump to analyze packets. This is helpful for identifying malformed packets or unauthorized traffic.
5.	iptables or firewalld: Use iptables -L or firewalld to check if firewall rules are blocking traffic.
6.	nslookup/dig: Use nslookup or dig to troubleshoot DNS issues, ensuring the domain name resolves to the correct IP.

********

5. Scenario: You notice high memory consumption on a server. How would you identify the cause and take corrective action?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	Monitor memory usage: Use top or htop to identify processes consuming high amounts of memory.
2.	Check memory usage breakdown: Run free -m to get a detailed breakdown of used, free, and cached memory.
3.	List memory-hogging processes: Use ps aux --sort=-%mem to get a sorted list of processes by memory usage.
4.	Investigate and restart processes: Identify any rogue or misbehaving processes consuming excessive memory and consider restarting them.
5.	Clear cache (if safe): If you suspect memory is being filled by cache, you can clear it (temporarily) with echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.
6.	Add swap space: If memory usage consistently exceeds available RAM, consider adding swap space as a buffer.

********

6. Scenario: How would you secure SSH access on a production server?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	Disable root login: Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set PermitRootLogin no to prevent root from logging in directly. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized root access.
2.	Use key-based authentication: Ensure PasswordAuthentication no is set in the SSH configuration, forcing users to authenticate using SSH keys rather than passwords.
3.	Change the default SSH port: Modify the Port directive in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to use a non-standard port (e.g., 2222) to reduce the likelihood of automated attacks.
4.	Restrict access with a firewall: Use iptables or ufw to restrict SSH access to specific IPs or ranges.
5.	Implement Fail2Ban: Install and configure Fail2Ban to ban IPs after multiple failed login attempts, protecting against brute-force attacks.
6.	Enable 2FA: Add two-factor authentication (2FA) to further secure SSH access, using tools like Google Authenticator or Duo.

********

7. Scenario: The disk space on a server is filling up rapidly. How would you address this issue?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	Find large files: Use du -sh /* or du -h --max-depth=1 to find which directories or files are consuming the most space.
2.	Find recently modified files: Use find / -type f -mtime -1 to identify files that have been recently modified and might be filling up the disk.
3.	Check log directories: Often, large log files in /var/log/ are the culprits. Investigate and truncate or rotate large logs.
4.	Use log rotation: Ensure logrotate is set up to rotate logs and prevent them from growing indefinitely.
5.	Clean package cache: Run apt-get clean (Debian-based) or yum clean all (RedHat-based) to free up space by clearing cached packages.
6.	Add disk space: If the above steps don’t resolve the issue, consider adding additional disk space or resizing existing partitions.

********

8. Scenario: You need to monitor a process's performance in real-time. What Linux commands would you use?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	top/htop: Use top or htop to monitor the system's overall resource usage, including CPU, memory, and load averages. These commands provide a real-time view of processes.
2.	strace: Use strace to trace system calls and signals for a specific process. This is helpful for debugging issues at the system call level.
3.	iotop: Monitor disk I/O usage by processes using iotop. It shows which processes are responsible for I/O load.
4.	dstat: Use dstat for a real-time overview of system resource usage, including CPU, disk, network, and memory.
5.	vmstat: Use vmstat to monitor virtual memory usage and system performance metrics like CPU, I/O, and memory utilization.

********

9. Scenario: You need to automate a repetitive task. How would you implement this in Linux?
•	Detailed Answer:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# This script automates a task
command1
command2
2.	Make the script executable: Use chmod +x <script.sh> to allow execution.
3.	Schedule with cron: Automate the execution of the script by scheduling it with cron. Use crontab -e to add a cron job. Example:
javascript
Copy code
0 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh
4.	Use systemd for complex tasks: If the task involves managing services or long-running processes, create a systemd service to manage and automate it.

*******

10. Scenario: You notice a "too many open files" error for a process. How do you resolve it?
•	Detailed Answer:
1.	Check current limits: Use ulimit -n to check the current limit on open files for the shell.
2.	Increase the limit temporarily: Use ulimit -n <new_limit> to increase the open file limit for the session.
3.	Make the change persistent: Add the new limits to /etc/security/limits.conf:
php
Copy code
<user> soft nofile 4096
<user> hard nofile 8192
4.	Modify system-wide limits: For system-wide changes, update /etc/sysctl.conf with:
arduino
Copy code
fs.file-max = 100000
Then apply the changes using sysctl -p.
